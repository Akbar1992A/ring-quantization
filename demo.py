"""
Quick Installation and Sanity Check Demo

This script performs a quick sanity check to ensure that the core components
of the Ring Quantization library are installed and working correctly.

It does the following:
1. Imports necessary libraries (torch, etc.).
2. Creates a 2-bit ResNet-20 model instance.
3. Performs a forward pass with a random tensor.

If this script runs without errors, your environment is likely set up correctly.
